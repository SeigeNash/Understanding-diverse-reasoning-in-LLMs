1. RDP/SSH Credentials
2. You should have maturity in both the mathematics of computer science and in the engineering of computer systems. This means that you should: have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms; be comfortable writing programs from scratch in C and Java; be comfortable writing and debugging assembly code; and be comfortable in a command-line Unix development environment (gdb, gcc, etc). You should also have a good understanding of computer architecture, operating systems, and computer networks. Most importantly, you should be eager to challenge yourself and learn more!

In statistics, an outlier is a data point that is significantly different from other observations. Outliers can be due to measurement variability, experimental error, or novel data. 

Outliers can have a big impact on statistical analyses and skew the results of hypothesis tests. For example, if student 4's grade was 90 (within the general range), the value of the mean would be 89.7 (also within the 85 - 95 range). 

Here are some ways to find outliers in a data set:
* Sort your data Sorting your data in ascending or descending order can help you identify any unusual data points.  
* Graph your data Graphs like scatter plots or histograms can help you see when a piece of data differs from the rest of the data set.  
* Calculate the z-score A z-score, or standard score, reveals how far away a data point is from the mean of the data. The further the z-score is from 0, the more unusual the data point is  


Here are some ways to handle outliers:
* Remove outliers: This prevents the data from becoming skewed. Outliers can be removed if they are due to human error or data processing errors.
* Cap outliers: Set a maximum and minimum value and assign that value to the outlier.
* Replace outliers: Use imputation methods to replace outliers with more reasonable values. These methods include using the mean, median, mode, or a constant value.
* Transform outliers: Use mathematical functions or techniques to alter the shape or scale of the data. This can improve the quality and distribution of the data.
* Treat outliers as two groups: Build individual models for both groups and then combine the output.

Other ways to handle outliers include:
* Reducing the weights of outliers
* Changing the values of outliers
* Using robust estimation techniques
* Double-checking outliers
* Changing the scale  
Two common graphical ways to detect outliers are boxplots and scatterplots. 

The Z-score method can also be used to detect outliers. The Z-score measures the variance of an observation from the mean in terms of standard deviation. A threshold range can be defined, and observations that fall outside the range are marked as outliers

Debug your code and do error analysis - think through all the error cases
Use Rogue - 2, consider only F1 score. For pairwise consider finding min, max, mean 
Make plots 
<< they are only putting high temperatures - so many that doesnt really guarantee the diversity of the rationales - our hypothesis>> 
<< so we calculate different similarity scores>>



Weekly status - (on Niloy sir’s mail chain)
1. What did you work in this week 
2. What are my Learnings 
3. To dos of next week 
4. 

For the report -
Write summaries of everything I have done 
And write a short detail of the important things I have learnt - the important points 








Observations 3 June to 9 June - 
1. The temperature was 0.7 in t70. No temp in other one
2. Considering only those datasets that performed well using FT CoT on DR
3. 7 datasets in total. 2 of them dont work 
4. There are no changes in the maximum value of any ROUGE score 
5. There is little to no change in the values of ROGUE score after cleaning the dataset - the model is robust, the incorrect reasonings are redundant 


Observations 10 June to 13 June - 
1. With BERT score, hit takes much longer to calculate results
2. Doubts in ROUGE being a good metric for our evaluation 
3. Fine-tune CoT with diverse reasoning performs better than Fine-tune CoT on all the tasks for all the models of varying parameter sizes. 



Bert score on gaggle and google colab 


Q - should I work on the datasets with only correct rationales, or the original datasets, or both? (Specifically in case of strategy)


1. BERT Score calculations (done)
2. Study the P-value 
4. Investigate how the author of this paper fine tune (done) 
6. Basic understanding of the scripts in the script folder (specifically focus on fine tuning model) (today)
7. Sequence to sequence (read about it)
8. How do you fine tune in Seq2Seq
9. Understand fine tuning (today)
10. Find out if somewhere win the paper they had mentioned if they had fine tuned the model over the data with incorrect rationales (done)
11. Understand how BERT works
12. Explore the results and the corresponding data points that give those results (today)
13. Understand the code base while focusing on the fine tuning aspect - see for the dataset with the highest model performance for 1.3B model (MultiArith) and only do it for a small portion of data on gaggle/colab to get an idea of what is happening. (Today) 








1. Learn shell, pip, git and other command line tools 
2. Understand what building wheels means 
3. Understand pickle and dill 
4. 






1. Make a proper GitHub repo for the project - includes a src folder, a readme, a bash script for running the code, a requirements.txt file etc 
2. Properly document the code - add appropriate variable names, do error analysis, add comments on how the code will run, what the code stores etc. 
3. Complete MMR for all metrics 
4. Complete MMR for BERT
5. Complete entire report 
6. Write code for calculating top-4, top-6 ranking (wouldn’t take that long)
7. Edit the internship letter document (ask piyush)
8. Talk about hostel fees and cycle fees 
9. Ask in college what documents are needed for the completion of internship
10. Clean your room 
11. Get waxed
